> A 5-lesson guide to understanding dyslexia and improving reading and writing for everyone.

## Introduction: Why learn about dyslexia

There are many reasons to learn about dyslexia. Here are just three of them.

1. **Help someone with dyslexia** without even realising they are dyslexic by producing more dyslexia-friendly documents
2. **Help yourself** by using some of the **technologies and strategies** for reading and writing that help people with dyslexia - they can improve everyone's writing
3. Produce documents that are easier to read for more people. **Dyslexia-friendly documents are easier to read for everyone.** Dyslexia-friendly documents are also easier to edit.

This page outlines **5 lessons you can learn**. You can read them all at once, or schedule 15 minutes each day for five days to learn a new skill and integrate it into your practice.

## Lesson 1: About dyslexia and its immediate impacts

### What to know
1. Dyslexia is a **learning difficulty** that makes it more **challenging to decode letters into words** during reading and to spell words during writing
2. Dyslexia is a **hidden disability**. This means that there is nothing that makes someone with dyslexia stand out in daily interactions
3. People are **identified as having dyslexia at every stage** of their educational journey as the need to rely on reading increases
4. Dyslexia is **not linked to intelligence** or any other quality. People with extremely high or low IQ can have dyslexia. **People with dyslexia can understand the content** of the text but they have to spend so much effort on decoding individual words, they have less left for overall meaning. Many successful academics have dyslexia
5. Dyslexia is **a life-long condition**, but it can be mitigated with training and technology.

### What to read
Read the official definition of dyslexia from the Rose report:
> 'Dyslexia is a learning difficulty that primarily affects the skills involved in accurate and fluent word reading and spelling.'

[What is dyslexia?, British Dyslexia Association (bdadyslexia.org.uk)](https://www.bdadyslexia.org.uk/dyslexia/about-dyslexia/what-is-dyslexia)

### What to do
**Try these two activities** to see what it might **feel like** to read or write when someone is dyslexic:
1. **Read a text in the mirror** or in very tiny font
2. **Write out a sentence by hand** but write every a as @ and every e as 3.

What **you will experience** is:
1. Your reading and writing will **slow down**
2. You will make **more errors**
3. You will have to **focus so much on individual words** that you will struggle to make sense of the whole.

## Lesson 2: Structured, undistorted text is dyslexia friendly

### What to know
Because dyslexia readers often read more slowly, they find it more **difficult to skim or scan a text**. Large chunks of undifferentiated text are very hard to process and may feel intimidating.

**Three easy things** you can do to make text more **dyslexia friendly**:
1. **Bold** key phrases in your paragraphs
2. Use numbers and **bullets** for **lists**
3. Labels sections with **headings** and mark them with **heading styles.**

## Lesson 3: Listening to text reduces processing overload

### What to know
One way in which a person with dyslexia can **reduce the processing overload** is to **listen** to text.

**Text to speech technology** has improved greatly and is now available to everyone for free.

### What to read
Read about **how and why to listen** to text at [academicreading.edutools.fyi](https://academicreading.edutools.fyi/)

### What to do
**Try listening to text:**
1. Open a **document or email you wrote** in **Word Online** or on your phone and choose **Read Aloud**
2. Open a **webpage or a PDF in Microsoft Edge** and choose **Read Aloud.**

This will **help you** in two ways:
1. You will have a better sense of how people with dyslexia and blind people **experience text**
2. You will be able to **improve your own reading** practices.

## Lesson 4: Dictating instead of writing reduces spelling overhead

### What to know
**Dictation can help** reduce the stress of spelling for a person with dyslexia.

There are now **many free tools for dictation**.

### What to read
Read about **why and how to dictate** at [academicproductivity.edutools.fyi](https://academicproductivity.edutools.fyi/)

### What to do
1. Open **Word Online** and try dictating a short piece of text
2. Think about what **benefits and challenges** a person with dyslexia will face when they use this method
3. Think about how you can **use dictation to help you** with your writing.

## Lesson 5: Visual aspects that make reading easier

### What to know
Although **dyslexia is not a visual difficulty**, visual aspects of text can further slow down processing.

The same things that help readers with dyslexia improve the processing for everyone.

#### Things that help
1. Do use
   a. larger font size
   b. increased line spacing
   c. shorter lines.
2. Do not use
   a. underline
   b. italics
   c. ALL CAPS.

**Warm background colours** (such as light cream) can also help with processing. But in general, it is best not to do this for documents as standard.

#### Things that do not help
Research has shown that two of the most commonly prescribed solutions for dyslexia do not work:
1. Dyslexia Font or other special fonts
2. Coloured overlays.

However, both may be preferred by people with dyslexia or others for a more comfortable reading experience.

### What to read
Read [readability.edutools.fyi](https://readability.edutools.fyi/)

### What to do
1. **Review one of your documents** or websites to see how you could make it more dyslexia friendly.
2. Learn to **enlarge documents** you are reading
3. **Change the background colour** on your reader software to reduce visual stress.
